    <p>Shepherd's pie produces a great aroma rivaled only by its taste.</p>
    <p>I always wonder why i don't make this more often!</p>

        <li>3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>3 celery ribs</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ap flour</li>
        <li>1 12 ounce bottle of Guinness</li>
        <li>1/4 cup worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill stockpot with potatoes and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork tender (about 25-30 minutes). </li>
        <li>Rice the potatoes in a large bowl. Combine with the heavy cream, melted butter, and 1 cup of parmesan cheese. Taste test the potatoes and season very well with salt and pepper to taste. Once satisfied with the taste, mix the egg yolks into the potatoes. </li>    
        <li>Preheat oven to 400f and set one rack in the middle and one towards the top 1/3 of the oven.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are boiling make the filling. Heat a large heavy pan or pot to medium-high heat then add the lamb.
        <li>Cook until well browned (about 7-10 minutes), then break up the lamb with a wooden spoon or meat masher. Next, add the carrots, onions, and celery along with a pinch of salt. Saute until the veggies are soft (about 5-7 minutes) then add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, stir, and cook for 3 minutes. Next, add the Guinness and turn the heat to high. With a wooden spoon scrape the bottom of the pot to remove all of the brown bits. Cook until the liquid has almost completely evaporated (about 3-4 minutes).</li>  
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium and add the flour. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until there is no white flour remaining in the pan. Add the beef stock, thyme, rosemary, peas, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by half. </li></li>
        <li>Taste test the filling and adjust salt, pepper, thyme, or rosemary if required.</li>
        <li>Add the filling to a 9x13" baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes on the top and with a fork or spoon fluff the potatoes making mounds or points. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. </li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the center of the oven. Move the dish towards the top of the oven and broil for 1-3 minutes or until well browned but not burnt. Watch carefully! Let the shepherd's pie sit for 10 minutes before eating so that it can settle. Enjoy!</li>
