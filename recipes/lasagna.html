    <h2>Delicious Lasagna, just like Carmella Soprano used to make</h2>
        <p>Homemade Lasagna, none of that frozen stuff the supermarket tries to sell you.</p>
        <p>You should use homemade sauce as it really enhances the flavor!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>three cans of Canned Tomatoes</li>
        <li>one can tomato paste</li>
        <li>one medium onion</li>
        <li>two cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>one pound lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>one pound mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>one cup pecorino romano</li>
        <li>one pound ricotta</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parsely</li>
        <li>1/4 cup basil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of kosher salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Boil the lasagna noodles (work in batches and stir well to avoid sticking) to very al dente (about 4-5 minutes). Scoop out sheets with a mesh strainer or pasta spider and shock in ice water. Lay flat the lasagna noodles on parchment paper or clean dish towels.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl combine all the ricotta mixture ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a 9 by 13 (or 10 by 15) baking dish place a drop of olive oil and wipe the bottom and sides. Next add a thick layer of meat sauce, completely coating the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 6 lasagna noodles on the first level (they should slightly overlap). Spread a thick layer of the ricotta mixture onto the noodles, then layer 1/3 of the mozzarella, another thick layer of meat sauce, and finally 1/3 of the grated Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>    
        <li>Repeat the process on the next two layers. On the top layer just add the sauce, mozzarella, and Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with a lightly oiled tin foil cover or parchment paper then foil to prevent sticking.</li>    
        <li>Bake the lasagna covered at 375f for 45 minutes in the middle of the oven. Bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes more until the side noodles are crispy and the cheese is bubbly. Enjoy!</li>    
    </ol>
